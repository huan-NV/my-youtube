Hello! Today, I want to share with you a story that took place in Saitama, Japan. Saitama is a province in the southeast, part of the greater Tokyo metropolitan area. In the southeast of Saitama lies Misato, a city about 20 kilometers from Tokyo, covering 30,000 square kilometers. Our story unfolds here, centering on a girl named Juncote, born on January 18, 1971.

At the time of the incident, she was just 17, a student at Rasio Minami High School in Saitama. Juncote was cheerful and sweet, well-liked by her classmates. Her father managed a canning factory, her mother was a homemaker, and she had both an older and a younger brother. The family struggled financially, with her father shouldering most of the burden. To help, Juncote decided to work after graduating high school. Besides her studies, she worked part-time at a household goods store and a plastics factory to support her family. As graduation approached, she aced a company interview and was ready to start a new chapter in her life.

But fate had other plans. One evening, on her way home from work, she encountered a nightmare that would change everything. What exactly happened that night? Let’s turn back the clock to November 25, 1988.

It was a beautiful Friday. As usual, after school, Juncote went to her part-time job at the plastics factory. At 8:20 PM, she finished work, packed her things, and set off for home by bicycle. The streets were dimly lit and almost deserted. Suddenly, a stranger on a motorcycle sped up behind her and kicked her, knocking both her and her bike to the ground. Before she could react, the man sped away. As she struggled to get up, a young man approached, offering help. He warned her that the attacker was from the underworld and might return. He offered to escort her home for safety. Still dazed and frightened, Juncote felt she could trust him, so she walked her bike and followed him.

After a while, they reached a secluded spot. The young man revealed that he, too, was part of a local gang, and the man on the motorcycle was his accomplice. His name was Hiroshi Mirano, 18, a dropout. He threatened Juncote, saying he would let her go if she spent the night with him, otherwise she would die. Terrified, she agreed.

At 9:50 PM, Hiroshi took her to a nearby hotel and assaulted her. But he didn’t keep his promise to let her go. Instead, he called three other gang members—Johnda, Shinji Minato, and Gia Sushi Wattanabe—to meet at a park. Around 3 AM, the three arrived by car. Together, they searched Juncote’s bag and found her diary with her home address. They threatened to kill her family if she tried to escape. Paralyzed by fear, she obeyed. After some discussion, the group decided to take her to Shinji’s house in the AiRa district of Tokyo, a two-story home with an electric gate where Shinji often brought friends.

Juncote’s parents, unaware of anything unusual, thought she was staying with friends and didn’t call the police. Two days later, on November 28, the group grew bored and invited two more friends to join their twisted games. The noise from their room drew the attention of Shinji’s father, who had just returned from a trip. When questioned, Shinji claimed Juncote was his new girlfriend and asked not to be disturbed. The six men then assaulted her together. Out of fear, Juncote endured, which only encouraged them further.

Days passed, and Juncote was repeatedly abused. One day, Shinji’s mother saw her in the house and told her to go home, but when she saw Juncote again days later, she stopped asking. The weather grew colder, and the group forced Juncote to strip and dance, even making her stand naked on the balcony in the freezing cold until she collapsed. To prevent her parents from calling the police, Hiroshi sometimes made her call home to reassure them. The group saw her obedience as a reason to keep her longer. When tired, one of them would stay behind to watch her while the others went out for food, only to return and continue their abuse.

Hiroshi even filmed the abuse and forced Juncote to watch. When her father died in an accident, the group mocked her grief. One member considered helping her escape but was caught and threatened. Eventually, Juncote tried to call the police, but Hiroshi caught her, beat her, and set her legs on fire as punishment. The others followed suit, burning other parts of her body. Her wounds festered, and the house reeked, but Shinji’s parents did nothing out of fear. Juncote could no longer walk and had to crawl, relieving herself where she lay. The group sometimes forced her to eat her own waste. Food became scarce, and she was often left hungry. Hiroshi beat her for soiling the floor, and the group frequently struck her face, leaving it swollen and unrecognizable. She was left in a state of utter despair, a plaything for their cruelty.

On the 41st day of captivity, Hiroshi, frustrated after losing money gambling, unleashed his anger on Juncote. Her consciousness faded, and her legs, now rotting, could no longer move. The group beat her for hours. The next morning, they found her dead. They wrapped her body in a blanket, stuffed it in a suitcase, and placed it in a steel drum. Hiroshi, superstitious, believed Juncote’s spirit would haunt him, so he put a videotape of her favorite Japanese drama, "Dragonfly," in the drum. They filled the drum with cement, sealed it, and tried to dump it in Tokyo Bay, but police presence forced them to abandon it in a field.

Eighteen days later, Hiroshi and an accomplice were arrested for another crime. During questioning, they confessed to Juncote’s murder. Police found the drum, and forensic evidence confirmed her identity. The autopsy revealed the extent of her suffering—broken teeth, shattered bones, and more. The gang was arrested and tried. Many felt the sentences were too lenient for such a monstrous crime. The case sparked national debate in Japan about juvenile crime and justice. Some of the perpetrators reoffended after release, their names forever linked to darkness. Juncote’s tragedy remains one of the most haunting cases in Japanese criminal history. May her story serve as a warning, and may justice never sleep. Thank you for listening to this story. See you in the next video. Goodbye!
