00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Welcome. Tonight, we unravel a chilling tale shrouded in mystery.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,740
Our story unfolds in Saitama Prefecture, Japan.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,920
Saitama, a province in the southeast, borders the vast Tokyo metropolis.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,480
In the southeast of Saitama lies Misato, a city veiled in secrets.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,260
Just 20 kilometers from Tokyo, Misato covers 30,000 square kilometers—a place where fate would take a dark turn.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,540
Tonight’s case begins here, in the shadowed streets of Misato.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,960
Our central figure: Junco, born January 18, 1971.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,040
At the time of the incident, she was just 17—a high school student with a bright future.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,860
She attended Rasio Minami High School, Saitama.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,740
Junco was cheerful, sweet, and beloved by her peers.

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,860
Her father managed a canning factory, her mother a homemaker. She had an older brother and a younger brother.

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,680
The family struggled financially, her father bearing the burden alone.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,540
To help, Junco decided to work after graduation.

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,740
She worked part-time in a household goods store and a plastics factory, supporting her family.

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,540
As graduation neared, she aced a company interview, ready to start a new chapter.

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,580
But fate had other plans. One night, on her way home from work, she encountered evil.

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,700
A demon crossed her path, and what followed would haunt all who heard the tale.

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,980
What happened that night? Let us turn back the clock to November 25, 1988.

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:01:01,560
[music]

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,200
It was a Friday, a seemingly ordinary day. After school, Junco went to her part-time job at the plastics factory.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,060
At 8:20 PM, she finished work and set off for home.

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,360
The streets were dim, nearly deserted. Suddenly, a man on a motorcycle struck her, knocking her and her bicycle to the ground.

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
Before she could react, the man sped away.

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,320
A young man appeared, offering help. He warned her the attacker was from the underworld, and might return.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,380
He offered to escort her home for safety. Dazed and frightened, Junco followed him.

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,660
But as they reached a secluded spot, the young man revealed his true nature: he too was part of a local gang.

27
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,820
His name was Hiroshi Minato, 18, a dropout. He attacked Junco, threatening her life if she did not comply with his demands.

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,340
Terrified, Junco agreed, hoping to survive the night.

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,740
Hiroshi took her to a nearby hotel, violating her trust and her body. But he did not let her go.

30
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,900
Instead, a darker plan emerged. He summoned three accomplices to a park.

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,660
The three—Shinji, Watanabe, and another—waited in a car. Together, they searched Junco’s bag, finding her diary and home address.

32
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,960
They threatened to kill her family if she tried to escape. Paralyzed by fear, Junco obeyed.

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,660
The group took her to Shinji’s house, a two-story home in Tokyo’s Aira district—a place that would become her prison.

34
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,060
[music]

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,660
Through phone calls, Junco’s parents suspected nothing. They believed she was staying with friends.

36
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,940
Two days later, the group grew bored and invited more friends to join their twisted games.

37
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,820
The noise drew Shinji’s father’s attention, but he was told Junco was just a girlfriend. The adults did not intervene.

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,720
Six men now tormented Junco. She endured unspeakable horrors, her spirit tested beyond imagination.

39
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,010
Even when Shinji’s mother discovered her, she did nothing. The abuse continued, day after day.

40
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,700
Winter’s chill seeped into the house. The gang forced Junco to dance naked, to stand on the balcony in the freezing cold, until she collapsed.

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,880
Her suffering grew. The group filmed their crimes, using the footage to further torment her.

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,980
When Junco’s father died in an accident, they mocked her grief.

43
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,800
One member considered freeing her, but was caught and threatened. The torture continued.

44
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,760
On the thirteenth day, Junco tried to escape, calling the police. But Hiroshi caught her, punished her with fire, and the others followed.

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,039
Her wounds festered, her body failing. Yet the adults in the house turned a blind eye, too afraid to act.

46
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,900
Junco could no longer walk, forced to crawl, to relieve herself where she lay. The gang’s cruelty knew no bounds.

47
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,900
They starved her, beat her, and forced her to eat filth. Her face became unrecognizable.

48
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,660
As her condition worsened, the group plotted her end. On the forty-first day, Hiroshi, angry from gambling losses, unleashed his rage upon her.

49
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,940
Junco’s consciousness faded. Her legs, rotting, could no longer move.

50
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,700
The group beat her for hours. The next morning, they found her dead.

51
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,160
They wrapped her body, placed it in a drum, and filled it with cement, hoping to erase all evidence.

52
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,400
They tried to dump the drum in Tokyo Bay, but police presence forced them to abandon it in a field.

53
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,180
Eighteen days later, Hiroshi and an accomplice were arrested for another crime. Under questioning, they confessed to Junco’s murder.

54
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,480
Police found the drum, Junco’s body inside, unrecognizable. Forensic evidence confirmed her identity.

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,300
The autopsy revealed the extent of her suffering—broken teeth, shattered bones, and more.

56
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,560
The gang was arrested and tried. The sentences, some argued, were too lenient for such a monstrous crime.

57
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,520
The case sparked national debate in Japan about juvenile crime and justice.

58
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,500
Some of the perpetrators reoffended after release, their names forever linked to darkness.

59
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,680
Junco’s tragedy remains one of the most haunting cases in Japanese criminal history.

60
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,200
May her story serve as a warning, and may justice never sleep.

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,020
Thank you for joining us on this journey into the shadows. Until next time, stay vigilant.
